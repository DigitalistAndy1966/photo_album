# photo_album
Experiements in finding faces and people in a photo album collection at home using some ML or AI methods.

Background is that I have a family of 5 where phone images over a number of years have been dumped. They are not organised. There are currently over 22000 images and videos. So automating person detection, or even object, to automatically group and then label metadata would be useful. 

At the moment these are a collection of evolutionary individual python files to work on that data.
